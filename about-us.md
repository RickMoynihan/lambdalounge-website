       The Î» lounge meets monthly to talk about and popularise
       new ways of thinking about computation.&nbsp; Frequent
       topics include, <b>functional programming</b>, <b>type
       systems</b>, <b>programming language design</b> and
       aspects of <b>computer science</b>.<br>
       <br>
       We are programming language agnostic, but have
       traditionally focused on exploring functional
       programming, though we are open to hosting more diverse
       talks on computer science topics.<br>
       <br>
       We were born from the Manchester&nbsp;<a href=
       "http://manchester.clojuredojo.org/" target=
       "_self">Clojure Dojo</a>, when we decided there would be
       more demand for a broader group focusing on functional
       programming in general. &nbsp;We asked politely and took
       the name from the American revolutionaries, of the
       original&nbsp;<a href="http://lambdalounge.org/" target=
       "_self">Lambda Lounge</a>&nbsp;in St Louis. &nbsp;Our
