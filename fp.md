      There are <a href=
      "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_programming_languages_by_type#Functional_languages"
      target="_self">dozens</a> of functional programming
      languages, and they can be as different from each other
      as <i>Ruby</i> and <i>Cobol</i>; however as a family
      they tend to:<br>
    </div>
    <div class=

      Emphasise the application and <strong>composition of
      functions</strong>, over the imperative mutation of
      state. Consequently functional programs are
      <strong>shorter</strong> and <strong>easier to reason
      about</strong>.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Prefer pure values</b> over <i>mutable objects</i>.
      Values never change, so programs using values are safer
      and easier to reason about.<br>
      <br>
      Treat functions as <strong>first-class values</strong>,
      allowing them to be passed as arguments and returned
      from functions. Higher order functions such as these
      enable powerful new abstractions.<br>
    </div>
    <div class="content maybe-two columns second">
      <strong>Focus on the primacy of data</strong>, rather
      than hiding it behind unwieldly classes.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Manage side effects more cleanly</b>&nbsp;meaning
      less state and fewer bugs. &nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      <strong>Be thread safe by default</strong>, without
      having to resort to locks which fail to
      compose.<strong><br>
      <br>
      Be a proving ground for awesome features</strong>.
      Garbage Collection, Closures, Continuations, Monads,
      Expression orientation, Lexical Scope, and Software
      Transactional Memories all made it into functional
      languages years before they were mainstream. &nbsp;What
      are you still missing?<br>

    Functional programming is not only on the cutting edge of
    computer science research, but it's being adopted by a
    leaner generation of startups who are innovating faster
    than their competitors.<br>

    language features, compilers, and fault tolerant
    systems.<br>
