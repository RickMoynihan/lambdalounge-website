<div><span>This Monday at <b>7pm</b> we're pleased to
announce we have another talk by Lee Kitching, this time
on Property Based Testing a Regex Processor in <a href=
"http://fsharp.org/" target="_self">F#</a> <a href=
"https://github.com/fscheck/FsCheck" target="_self">with
FsCheck</a>.<br>
<br>
Traditional unit testing requires the programmer to
manually generate test cases, which are highly specific
but give poor coverage of the range of possible
inputs.<br>
<br>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QuickCheck"
target="_self">Property-based testing</a> is used to
specify the behaviour of programs and assert the
adherence of the implementation to the specification by
randomly exploring the input space.<br>
<br>
This talk introduces property-based testing FsCheck, an
F# port of Quickcheck. The API will be introduced before
being demonstrated in development of a simple regular
expression engine, and used to check invariants for data
structures.<br></span>
