This month, we'll be learning about RIO, a standard library for developing applications in Haskell. 
This event is suitable for beginners and experienced Haskell programmers alike.

This talk will introduce RIO, a new standard library aimed at simplifying the development experience in Haskell 
particularly with regards to applications development. Amongst others, RIO is one tool that provides language beginners 
and experts alike with conveniences that alleviate many of the sticking points that developers and engineers often find 
themselves in when trying to learn and use the language.

We'll discuss the basic motivation for RIO, how to get started and navigate the library, and walk through the basic 
anatomy of a RIO application. We'll see how RIO can assist beginners in getting a better understanding of the Haskell 
ecosystem at large, and how it can assist seasoned Haskell developers in simplifying their existing codebases.

Dan Firth is an independent Haskell consultant and mathematician with experience in industry sectors such as automotive, 
finance, and web development. 
Dan has been writing and teaching Haskell for 7 years, and over that time has designed training programs aimed at 
bringing new developers unfamiliar with Haskell up to speed and writing applications in the language with confidence 
and fluency.

Food and refreshments will be available! Please let us know if you have any special dietary requirements.
