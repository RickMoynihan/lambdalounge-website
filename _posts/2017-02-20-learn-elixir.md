   We're meeting on Monday <b>20</b>th Feb at 7pm at
   <b>madlab</b> to learn Elixir!<br>
   <strong>Elixir</strong> is a dynamic, functional
   language with Ruby-like syntax that runs on the Erlang
   virtual machine. With first class support for
   <strong>concurrency, scalability, fault
   tolerance</strong> and <strong>high
   availability</strong>, all courtesy of its Erlang
   roots, it can be described as the language for today's
   real time, hyper-connected world.<br>
   <br>
   In this short introduction to Elixir presented by
   <a href="https://twitter.com/thisischichi">Chi-chi
   Ekweozor</a>, learn how to use the ubiquitous
   <strong>pipeline operator |&gt;</strong> to consume
   functions as data, <strong>pattern matching, modules,
   lists</strong> and other language constructs. Level up
   and get writing distributed software applications that
   go beyond the browser on to mobile and the Internet of
   Things.<br>
   <br>
   <strong>** Please note: Hands-on Session
   **</strong><br>
   This is a hands-on session, to follow along please come
   with a laptop with Elixir pre-installed. There are
   <a href=
   "http://elixir-lang.org/install.html">instructions for
   installing Elixir and Erlang</a> on most operating
   systems on the <a href=
   "http://elixir-lang.org">Elixir-lang website</a>.
