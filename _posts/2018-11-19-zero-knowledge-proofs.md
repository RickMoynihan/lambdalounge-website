[Daira Hopwood][Daira], a LamdaLounge regular, will tell us about Zero-knowledge proofs, a fascinating area of cryptography with wide applications for security and the blockchain.

> Zero-knowledge proofs allow Alice to prove to Bob that she knows a secret, without having to reveal it.

With zero-knowledge proofs, you can validate in `O(1)` space and time that an arbitrary amount of computation occurred correctly. This remarkable property depends, at least for now, on writing programs in a peculiar (and peculiarly terrible) mathematical language called R1CS (Rank 1 constraint systems).

This talk is an introduction to writing efficient R1CS programs.
