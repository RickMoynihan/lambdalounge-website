This month we have an interactive music workshop with:

#### Jenn Kirby ([composer and musician][jenn]) - Workshop on Dataflow music programming 

Dr [Jenn Kirby][jenn] is a composer, performer, lecturer and music technologist. Jenn teaches music at the University of the West of Scotland. Her output includes contemporary instrumental composition, electroacoustic music, sound art, noise music, experimental pop, laptop orchestra performance and solo live electronics. Jenn builds software, uses wearables and re-purposed games controllers as musical interfaces, to create and perform theatrical live electronic music.

Jenn is a prominent live-electronic music performer and has had music performed in Ireland, the United Kingdom, Austria, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Germany, Italy, Poland, Canada, the United States and Mexico.

The workshop will offer an introduction to programming music systems using the Pure Data programming environment. Participants will be introduced to audio synthesis and working with controllers to programme expressive digital musical instruments.

Through an in-depth look at software instruments, participants will have the opportunity to make music together finding new means of musical expression.

*Resources needed*: Laptop and headphones.

Participants will need to install [Pd-Extended 0.43][Pd-Extended]
and [Pure Data 0.50][Pure-Data].
