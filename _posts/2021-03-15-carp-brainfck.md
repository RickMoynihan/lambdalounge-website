## Building a compiler for the esoteric programming language Brainfuck, in Carp Lisp

Lisp macros are known to be a powerful and scary feature for metaprogramming. We rely on it heavily in [Carp][carp], a statically compiled and typed language, both to generate code and to build abstractions.

Continuing with our Lisp mini-season, weâ€™re going to build a little [Brainfuck][brainfuck] compiler in the Carp macro system. This will emit Carp code true to the Brainfuck input program. What could be more fun than a compiler inside another compiler?"

[Veit Heller][veit] is a jack of all trades, but a master of none. He frequently oscillates between compiler development, writing, creating generative art, and trying to get work done at his day job as a technologist at large.
