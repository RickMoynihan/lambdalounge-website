<div><span>This monday at 7pm <a href=
"http://twitter.com/RickMoynihan" target="_self">Rick
Moynihan</a> is talking about Clojure, the functional
Lisp for the JVM.<br>
<br>
The interactive REPL driven demonstration will try and
provide a whistlestop tour of Clojure and its workflow,
showcasing unique aspects of the language and its
workflows.&nbsp; Depending on what people want to see, we
can touch on topics ranging from <a href=
"http://clojure.org/reference/macros" target=
"_self">macros</a> and meta programming to interacting
with Lisp at the REPL, using profilers to diagnose
performance issues, tools such as <a href=
"http://leiningen.org/" target="_self">Leiningen</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/clojure/tools.nrepl" target=
"_self">nREPL</a>, Paredit, or <a href=
"https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider" target=
"_self">CIDER</a>, or the concurrency options available
to you such as futures, promises, <a href=
"http://clojure.org/reference/agents" target=
"_self">agents</a>, <a href=
"http://clojure.org/reference/atoms" target=
"_self">atoms</a> and the <a href=
"http://clojure.org/reference/refs" target=
"_self">Software Transactional Memory</a>.<br>
<br>
Or perhaps any other core language features such as
<a href="http://clojure.org/reference/protocols" target=
"_self">protocols</a>, <a href=
"http://clojure.org/reference/multimethods" target=
"_self">multimethods</a>, <a href=
"http://clojure.org/reference/data_structures" target=
"_self">persistent data structures</a>, <a href=
"http://clojure.org/reference/sequences" target=
"_self">lazy sequences</a>, <a href=
"http://clojure.org/reference/transducers" target=
"_self">transducers</a>, that I can talk about.<br>
<br>
I won't be able to cover everything, but I'll try my best
to give you a flavour of this practical language.<br>
