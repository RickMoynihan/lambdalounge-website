## Introduction to Cats Effect and Weaver Test

Get tickets on [Skiddle][Skiddle] or see the box below. Watch the [Livestream][Livestream].

This month we have Anton and Olivier from Disney Streaming Services will talk about effect types in Scala, what they are, why they matter, and introduce the [Cats Effect][cats-effect] project.
Then they will introduce a new test framework, [Weaver Test][weaver-test], that they have built using Cats Effect in Scala.

This meetup is in collaboration with [Scala Manchester][scala-manchester].

Obviously in the strange times that we live in we can't go to the pub after the talks, however please do join us on our new [discord server][Discord].
We are still getting setup with this, so let us know if there is anything you would like to see on there.
