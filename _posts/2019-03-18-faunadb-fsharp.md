Our own Conor Farrell will talk about FaunaDB, a distributed NoSQL database written in Scala and with a functional query language. It claims to combine the scale and flexibility of NoSQL with the safety and data integrity of relational databases. Does it live up to the hype?

Luce Carter will give a lightning fast (pun intended) introduction to F# Cross-Platform Mobile Development with Xamarin and Fabulous. In this talk, Luce will give you a very quick demo of what Fabulous is and how it can be used to create fully native mobile apps for iOS, Android, UWP and more with full 100% native API access.

Food and refreshments will be provided.
