<h3>Application development with Purescript</h3>
<div>
  <br>
  Join us on the 20th July at 7pm at Madlab, where
  <a href="https://twitter.com/beckyconning" target=
  "_self">Becky Conning</a> tells us about her path
  from Javascript to <a href=
  "http://www.purescript.org/" target=
  "_self">Purescript</a>.<br>
  <br>
</div>
<div>
  Becky's team uses Javascript for everything and over
  time has found the approaches and technologies that
  were helping them the most have their roots in
  functional programming.<br>
  <br>
</div>
<div>
  Purescript is written in and inspired by Haskell.
  Luckily for us web developers, Purescript modules
  compile to CommonJS modules making&nbsp; it
  surprisingly easy to interface between Javascript and
  Purescript in both directions.<br>
  <br>
  There are also versions of Purescript in development
  that compile to Python and C++.

  Becky will be sharing her excitement about the
  possibilities of functional programming for
  application development with you and we’ll building a
  small application to help get you motivated.

  So whether you’re a Javascript developer, a seasoned
  functional programmer or just interested in
  applications come on down and get excited about
  Purescript and functional programming for
  applications!
