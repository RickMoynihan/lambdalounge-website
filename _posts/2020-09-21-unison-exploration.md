## Exploring Unison in... er... unison

Get tickets on [Skiddle][Skiddle] or see the box below. Watch the [Livestream][Livestream].

For our September online meetup, we'll do something a little different, and explore [Unison][Unison] together!

> '*Unison* is an open source functional programming language based on a simple
> idea with big implications: code is content-addressed and immutable.'

Unison has been on our 'That Looks Interesting' list for a long time. At this meeting, we'll live stream our first steps with the programming language, the environment, and see what we can learn.

Join us and help shape the exploration by commenting on our [YouTube stream][YouTube] or [Discord][Discord] page.

===

Obviously in the strange times that we live in we can't go to the pub after the talks, however please do join us on our new [discord server][Discord].
We are still getting setup with this, so let us know if there is anything you would like to see on there.
