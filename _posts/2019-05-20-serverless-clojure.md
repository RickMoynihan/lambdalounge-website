Our next meeting is on Monday 20th May at Barclays Eagle Labs in Albert Square (Union, Albert Square, Manchester, M2 6LW).

The meeting starts at the usual time of 1900 (doors open a little earlier, we aim to start by 1905).

Please [register][eventbrite] to let us know you'll be attending.

Where we're going, we don't need servers!

Our own Alex Lynham ([@hipsters_unite][alex] - [blog][alex-blog]) will help us find out how the Serverless framework and ClojureScript can be used in anger, what the gotchas are, and how you might go about making a development workflow using it.

By the end of the session, you should have a mini-API using Lambdas and ClojureScript deployed on AWS, as well as some idea of how these tools fit together with your text editor and development process.

Warning! Contains parens!

N.B. We're just going to be focussing on using these two together during the session, we won't be deep diving into Lambda Layers or any peripheral cool stuff, though we can talk about it at the pub!

Please ensure that you have:

  - Installed Clojure, preferably via Leiningen
  - Installed Node.js
  - An AWS account (please double-check that billing limits are set!)
  - Your favourite text editor

Food and refreshments will be provided.
