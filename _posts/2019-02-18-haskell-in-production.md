Our next meeting is on Monday 18th February
at [Barclays Eagle Labs][EagleLabs] in Albert Square
(Union, Albert Square, Manchester, M2 6LW).

The meeting starts at the usual time of 1900 (doors open a little earlier, we aim to start by
1905).

Please [register][eventbrite] to let us know you'll be attending.

Join Chris Bacon as he explains how Tracsis uses Haskell to help solve real world data capture, reporting and resource optimisation problems. 

He'll also discuss lessons learned about using Haskell in production, in particular:
 - how to incorporate SOLID into Haskell code
 - further use cases that might be good fits for Haskell.
 
Food and refreshments will be provided.
