Reagent and Re-Frame are functional reactive tools and a micro-framework for React, written in Clojure(script) that have 
led the way in thinking about how React JS apps can be structured and written.

Examples of their influence are JS frameworks like Redux, and the introduction of Hooks into React.

In this workshop, you'll build a simple Re-Frame application, learning along the way how the key concepts/dominoes in the Re-Frame system work:

- App-db
- Subs
- Effects
- Views

You'll also see how to debug your apps, and how to integrate build tools like Shadow-CLJS, as well as interop with the Node libraries you know and love (if we have time!)

**N.B.** Please bring your laptop with you!

Before attending, you'll need to make sure that you have:

- Git installed
- Node installed
- The JVM installed

We'll be cloning a repo from GitHub to get started, and then working from there.

Food and refreshments will be provided; please let us know of any special requirements.

This meeting is kindly supported by [Equal Experts][EE] and [Barclays Eagle Labs][EagleLabs].
