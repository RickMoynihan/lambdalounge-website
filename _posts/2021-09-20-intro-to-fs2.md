[FS2][fs2] gives purely functional, effectful, and polymorphic stream processing library in the Scala programming language. In this talk Domas Poliakas introduces you to FS2's beautiful abstractions and combinators that make stream processing a dream. From type safety to resource safety, from push to pull, from video to web api requests, accelerate your development and compute with FS2.

Domas Poliakas is a Senior Engineer at [Precog][precog] and contributor to the [FS2][fs2] and [Cats Effect][cats-effect] Libraries.
