## October meetup: Functional TypeScript

Get tickets on [Skiddle][Skiddle] or see the box below. Watch the [Livestream][Livestream].

Functional approaches in Typescript are nothing new, but what can we apply from
FP to structuring a Typescript app in a functions-as-a-service framework? 

[Alex Lynham][Alex] will introduce some practical FP approaches that have
delivered the most consistent value in our project.

Join us and please comment on our [YouTube stream][Livestream] or [Discord][Discord] page.

Obviously in the strange times that we live in we can't go to the pub after the talks, however please do join us on our new [discord server][Discord].
We are still getting setup with this, so let us know if there is anything you would like to see on there.
