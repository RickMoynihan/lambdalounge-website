Join us for Lambda Lounge this month as [Codurance][codurance] co-founder Mashooq Badar talks about Clojure and software craftsmanship:

“Programming in Clojure is an absolute joy! I will take you through a few features of the language that make it my favourite. 
The talk will be a series of live demos showcasing these features.”

During Mashooq's diverse career, he has succeeded in creating highly effective software teams and departments. 
His broad and deep technical knowledge, organisational skills, craft focus, and empathy to people involved have been integral to his success. 
He prides himself at being a hands-on software developer and believes that software development skills are very hard 
to learn and the best way to maintain them is to apply them.

This meeting is kindly supported by [Dept][dept] and [Codurance][codurance].
