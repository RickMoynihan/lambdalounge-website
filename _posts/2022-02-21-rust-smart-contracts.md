## Rust Smart Contracts

Rust Smart Contracts, or: how I learned to stop worrying and write Rust full-time despite not being very good at it

This talk has a meme:content ratio of 2:1 which its author can only apologise for. It should of course have more memes. In it, we will cover some of the essential moving parts in the [CosmWasm][CosmWasm] smart contracts toolchain, as well as dig through the code of an example contract.

## Speaker

the-frey is an engineer who often writes in the third person. After many years working in Clojure, they somehow found themselves working on smart contracts in Rust. Rust is cool and smart contracts are pretty cool too, so hopefully this talk will be cool.
