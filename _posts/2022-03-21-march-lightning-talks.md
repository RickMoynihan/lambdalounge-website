## March Lightning Talks

Get tickets on [EventBrite][EventBrite] (to stay informed) or just watch the [Livestream][Livestream].

We're running another round of lightning talks this month at Lambda Lounge.

This month, we have four speakers:

* Dan 'ouroborus' Strong:  Policy-as-Code: a demo of the Rego query language

* Veit Heller: The Glamorous Toolkit for the Functional Programmer.

* Hakim Cassimally: Functional Bash

* Charles Dixon - NuShell + Rust = CouchShell!

We are looking into meeting up again at some point this year, maybe? 
But in the meantime, please do join us on our new [discord server][Discord].
