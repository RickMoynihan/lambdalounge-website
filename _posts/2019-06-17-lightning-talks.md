This month we have four excellent lightning talks, three of which are about functional python!

#### Nick Froud - Tidal Cycles

Nick Froud will give us an introduction to Tidal Cycles, a live coding music environment built with Haskell. 

#### James Fielder ([@James_Fielder][james]) - Coconut, FP for the Python world

A very quick tour of Coconut, an FP language that is designed as a superset of Python (much as Typescript is to Javascript). We’ll have a look at the syntax and maybe see how we can use it to make some programs nicer.

#### Hakim Cassimally ([@osfameron][hakim]) - Drawing squiggly lines in Python, functionally

If you’ve ever seen https://explainshell.com/ and thought “That’s great, but shouldn’t it be in the shell?” (and can it explain itself?) then this is the talk for you. Hakim will show a shell explainer written in FP Python.

#### Alex Lynham ([@hipsters_unite][alex]) - Fun with Python functools

Even without something like Coconut, Python does have some support for functional programming. Let’s take a look at some functional Python together, and maybe even deploy it to AWS Lambda while we’re at it.
