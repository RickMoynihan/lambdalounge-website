For this month's session, we'll be running a beginner's workshop on building and deploying Clojure web applications. 

Although you don't have to be an expert programmer, some familiarity with another programming language, and a bit of experience with using tools like Git will be useful. If you don't have that, then don't worry, just install the pre-requisites below and sign up.

We'll go through some common toolchains for building Clojure web applications and then build and deploy a simple example on Heroku. 

After that, we'll look at how you can add templating, and how REPL-driven development works for web applications.

By the end of the workshop you should have a small web application deployed to Heroku.

As the session is a workshop format, attendees will need to bring their own laptop. *Please ensure that you have*:

> Installed [Clojure, preferably via Leiningen][lein]

> Installed the [Heroku toolbelt][heroku]
