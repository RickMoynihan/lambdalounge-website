## An Introduction to Systems Thinking for Programmers

Jakob Durstberger provides an introduction to Systems thinking. Jakob has been very fortunate to have worked with a lot of different technologies in a lot of different domains. With that he has never got too attached to one technology and always found how to solve the problems more interesting than what tools to solve them with. 

Systems thinking is the study of groups of related, interdependent parts. But more than that it is a way of comprehending your surroundings and how you got into them. I will first introduce some Systems Thinking basics and then explore how those can be applied to programming.
