## A journey through parsing and evaluating a small Lisp-like language.

[Sam Marshall][sam] will take us on a journey through parsing and evaluating a small Lisp-like language. The interpreter is small and can be extended after the event is over (maybe the start of the next big programming language?).

No prior Elixir or Lisp experience is needed, as concepts will be explained as we go. If you'd like to code along, bring an [Elixir install](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html)!

NB: The video Sam mentioned was  ["The Most Beautiful Program Ever Written"(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyfBQmvr2Hc&ab_channel=PapersWeLove)
