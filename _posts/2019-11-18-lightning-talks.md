This month we have <number> lightning talks

#### Frankie Gough - What's New in Scala 3 (and why you should care)

A brief guided tour of some of the highlights of Scala 3, and what they mean for everyday functional programming

#### Conor Farrell ([@SectoidCmdr][conor]) - Functional Kotlin

A brief introduction to how you can use Kotlin functionally! Spoiler alert: it's nicer than Java. 

#### Alex Lynham ([@hipsters_unite][alex]) - Monadic deferreds in Clojure - just ddo it!

A lightning talk on how (and why) we use monads as the building block for our work with deferreds at Yapster, and why this may be a useful tool in your Clojure(script) programs too.

#### Paul Wild ([@pw_x][paul])- Using F# to parse poker hand history

Any edge in online poker could mean the difference between winning that big pot or losing everything. Luckily every hand played is recorded in log files and analyzing this data could be the first step towards the final table of the world series.

With that goal in mind this talk will introduce F#s parser combinator library fparsec and apply it to understanding this log history. Expect plenty of code examples and a demo or two.
