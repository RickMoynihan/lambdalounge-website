## August Lightning Talks

Get tickets on [Skiddle][Skiddle] or see the box below. Watch the [Livestream][Livestream].

We're running another round of lightning talks this month at Lambda Lounge.

This month, we have four speakers:

#### **Liam Griffin-Jowett - Rust**
Have you ever wanted to know about the basics of the Rust ownership system? No? Well then don't attend this talk, because it is about the basics of the Rust ownership system. We'll cover things like 'what even is borrowing?', 'what does '&mut ***i' mean?', and 'ok, but what does a rest api look like?'. Sprinkled here and there will be opinions that I've stolen from smarter people on why Rust is good and why it's the future.

#### **Alex Lynham - Functional Serverless Typescript**
Functional approaches in Typescript are nothing new, but what can we apply from FP to structuring a Typescript app in a functions-as-a-service framework? This lightning talk will quickly go over some practical FP approaches that have delivered the most consistent value in our project.

#### **Conor Farrell - Functional + Java**
Insert your favourite chocolate + peanut butter ad reference here! I'll discuss some ways you can make your Java code more functional using Vavr, a library that provides persistent data types like Tuple and Seq and functional control structures like Try and Either.

#### **Hakim Cassimally - Purescript**
Learn about parsing Git diffs for fun and profit using Purescript!

Obviously in the strange times that we live in we can't go to the pub after the talks, however please do join us on our new [discord server][Discord].
We are still getting setup with this, so let us know if there is anything you would like to see on there.
